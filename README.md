# DENO-LIB
Collection of projects and libraries using [Deno](https://deno.land). 

As of this writing, Deno 1.0 is out and much too discover and learn. Directory structure and other changes may happen as standard processes and procedures are implemented.

## Libraries

* GQL-TS - this is a GraphQL to TypeScript conversion. Reads directly from a `schema.json` or from a GraphQL endpoint. 
    * **NOTE:** this is for Introspection Query _ONLY_!!
* GQL-Builder - builds a GraphQL query using Linq-style expression in Typescript
* Ms-Project-Tree - a simple tool to read data from Visual Studio project files and output to a csv. While working with a large repo with
over 500+ projects, I wanted to see the current framework version and references.
