# GQL Builder for Typescript
Wanted a way to write strongly-typed GraphQL queries in Typescript.  
For demos, look at the `_test.ts` file.

To run tests
```
deno test --allow-net _test.ts
```

## Features (so far..)

* [Query] Simple query, no nested fields
* [Query] One-to-one nested fields
* [Query] One-to-many nested fields
* [Query] Alias field names
* [Query] queries with arguments
* Execute function with Fetch Api

to be continue...

* mutations
* variables
* fragments
